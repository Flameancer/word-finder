# word-finder

This is a word finder written in python. It reads through a .txt and finds the most common word in the files and outputs the results. 
This is very basic and only used for demonstrations.

To run the word finder just add the path of the text file as a single commandline argument. 

example: `python "word finder.py" somedocument.txt`
